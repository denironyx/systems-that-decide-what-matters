### Nature of Identity

Birth certificates are source of legal identity and a proof of citizenship, and thus the basis for individual identity in most countries. Civil registration has become the foundation for how state relate to their citizens. People present proof of civil registration for many purposes: to prove who they are and, springing from that, their citizenship.

When most people hear the word identity, they think about birth certificates, passports, driver's licenses, logins, and other sorts of credentials. But clearly we are more than our ***legal identity***. For most purposes and interactions, our identity is defined through our relationships.

For Most cases identity is something other assign to us whether is our driver license, civil status, legal status, etc. but it is also something deep inside of us.

The question also remains "Are we more than a set of attributes?" , that bundle of attributes, each with independent value based on the known philosophy as -- bundle theory by David Hume.

Substance theory: holds that attributes are borne by "an entity which exists in such a way that it needs no other entity to exist" and and according Descartes, Substance theory give rise to the idea of persistence in the philosophy of personal identity.

That is, People, Organization, Places and things persist through time. In one sense, you are the same person you were when you were 16. But in another, you are not. The thing that makes you the same person over your lifetime is substance. The thing that makes you different is the collection of ever-changing attributes you present to the outside world over time. That could be the colour of your hair, your values, belief, place of location, legal identity.

Digital Identity
---
The web is built on the assumption that people, organizations, places, and things are bundles of attributes. There is no substance, at least in the digital sense, since the only thing tying them together is you - a decidedly nondigital entity. 

At the present, we are not a digitally embodied - that is our digital existence depends on other entities. We have no digital substance to connect the various attributes you present online. Because of the lack of digital representation of you, that you alone control. 

At the moment we don't control any of our digital presences, and our online existence is operationalized by using. but what will a digitally maintained autonomous human being look like?

Simple identity system:

Companies offering an online services designs digital identity as simplistic as possible; that is they focus on the object of the online services which is to know who the people at the other end of the connection. And to do this, you expect user to set up an account, give a username and password, and let us log in. Then collect any necessary attributes in a nice, tidy bundle and store them in the account as profile. Job done.

Note:

Identity is the foundation for all but the most trivial online services. Suppose a workflow that you're building needs a signed attestation that certain work has been performed and includes the details about the work. The result is a secure, digital, machine-readable, auditable record of what's occurred. The workflow requires that this attestation is authentic. How do you ensure that?

The document might be considered authentic if it's signed by someone or something that's been authenticated, if the cryptographic processes have the fidelity necessary to inspire confidence in the result, and if there's some process that establishes the provenance of the document. Authentication, confidence, and provenance are all based on identity.

Beyond services, many document we use every day have identity-related purposes. A movie ticket, an invoice that identifies a transaction taking place inside a larger relationship. all of these and milions more are part of digital identity.

Identity isn't as simple as tying legal identifiers (entity references) to people. That is tie a body (through biometrics) to legal identifier. While this can reduce fraud, identity systems that do this are almost always privacy disasters because they must collect lots of personal information to be universal.

- > Identity in one form or another, is foundational to nearly every transaction, relationship, and interaction, identity systems are polymorphic(they have many form). tying a legal identifier to people is just only some form of the problem.
