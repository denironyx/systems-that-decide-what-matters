# Reading Note:
- Trying to connect entities to digital identity. So, far what makes sense is that entities are real-world objects that is a person, place, or thing. And digital identity which contains data that uniquely describes a person or thing, but also contain information about the subject's relationship to other entities.
- Birth certificates are source of legal identity and a proof of citizenship, and thus the basis for individual identity in most countries. Civil registration has become the foundation for how state relate to their citizens. People present proof of civil registration for many purposes: to prove who they are and, springing from that, their citizenship.
